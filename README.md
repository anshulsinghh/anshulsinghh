    :wave: Hi! I design for GitHub.
    <br>My current work focuses on enabling all of y'all to
      <br><em>receive recognition</em> for the amazing things that
    <br>you do in your software communities :sparkles:<br><br>

  I want to make a little game this year.<br>I'm currently working on a small gameboy game with <a href="https://github.com/tfgrimes">@tfgrimes</a> using <a href="https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio">GBStudio.dev</a>, which is an awesome game creator tool that makes it really easy to design a game if you're primarily focusing on the art and story (like myself). I'm hoping to print this on a cartridge when I'm done so you can actually experience it on a Gameboy!
